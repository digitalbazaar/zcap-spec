  <!-- This document follows the following rules following indentation:
        - Indent tags appropriately according to nesting depth
        - Newline after every sentence (this helps making reading git diffs
          easier, as well as merging in complicated changes, because a change
          will only affect a sentence at a time rather than a complete
          paragraph)
        - Wrap text at column 79 (the least critical of the three conventions
          since this merely helps the text look nicer in many text editors)

      <p>
        Linked Data Capabilities (<code>ld-ocap</code> for short) provide a
        secure way for linked data systems to grant and express authority
        utilizing the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">
          object capability model</a>.
        Capabilities are expressed through "proclamation chains" which are
        themselves linked data objects signed through
        <a href="https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/ld-signatures/">
          Linked Data Signatures</a>.
        Linked Data Capabilities support delegating authority to other entities
        on the network.
        "Caveats" may be attached to proclamations which may be used to
        restrict the scope of their use, for example to restrict the methods
        which may be used or providing a mechanism by which the capability may
        be later revoked.
