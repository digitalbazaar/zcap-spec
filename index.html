  <!-- Style guide for this document:
        - Indent tags appropriately according to nesting depth
        - Newline after every sentence (this helps making reading git diffs
          easier, as well as merging in complicated changes, because a change
          will only affect a sentence at a time rather than a complete
          paragraph)
        - Wrap text at column 79 (the least critical of the three conventions
          since this merely helps the text look nicer in many text editors)

        Linked Data Capabilities (<code>ld-ocap</code> for short) provide a
        secure way for linked data systems to grant and express authority
        utilizing the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">
          object capability model</a>.
        Capabilities are expressed through "proclamation chains" which are
        themselves linked data documents signed through
        <a href="https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/ld-signatures/">
          Linked Data Signatures</a>.
        Linked Data Capabilities support delegating authority to other entities
        on the network.
        "Caveats" may be attached to proclamations which may be used to
        restrict the scope of their use, for example to restrict the methods
        which may be used or providing a mechanism by which the capability may
        be later revoked.

         - Alyssa has a car: ACL edition
         - Alyssa has a car: ocap edition

         - Alyssa wants to let her roommate/friend Ben drive, she delegates a
           capability to him.  Alyssa trusts Ben, but decides it's her car, so
           she wants the ability to change her mind if for example they are no
           longer roommates, so she adds a caveat that says that Ben can drive
           the car unless Alyssa revokes that permission

         - Ben drives to an event with valet parking.  Lem E. Driveit, the
           valet, asks for Ben's key so that he may park the car, but Ben
           decides that it would be most responsible for him to make sure that
           Lem can't take Alyssa's car for a joyride, so when delegating a
           capability to drive Alyssa's car, he adds an additional caveat:
           this valet-key capability can only be driven for five kilometers,
           which is long enough to park a car with some buffer, but short
           enough to not permit Lem to take a joy ride.

           The ability to delegate and add caveats are wonderful features.
           However, they aren't the only reason to choose Capabilities over ACLs...

      <p>
        This document does not cover a specific method for delivering
        Linked Data Capabilities to an object, though something like
        the inbox property and associated delivery mechanisms from
        Linked Data Notifications and ActivityPub is one possible
        system.
        However there is nothing about Linked Data Capabilities that is
        specific to HTTP; for example, both proclamations and invocations
        could be stored on a blockchain or a distributed hash table.

        <dt>capability</dt>
        <dd>
          Authority which may be invoked to perform some operation upon a
          (linked data) object.
          Represented as a proclamation chain within the context of
          Linked Data Capabilities.
        </dd>

        <dt>caveat</dt>
        <dd>
          Also known as "attenuation" within object capability literature,
          a "caveat" may be attached to a proclamation as a restriction on
          how that capability may be used.
          Delegated capabilities will preserve caveats and may be themselves
          may be further restricted by adding more caveats.
        </dd>

        <dt>invocation</dt>
        <dd>
          The "activation" of a capability, represented as a linked data
          document which is signed in such a way that matches authority
          granted through a prior proclamation.
          <!-- TODO: fix up awkward wording here -->
          An invocation may have arguments, similar to how a procedure call
          may have arguments.
        </dd>

        <!-- TODO: Maybe this should be removed, because it's hard not
           to use object in other ways-->
        <dt>object</dt>
        <dd>
          Though the term object has
          <a href="http://mumble.net/~jar/articles/oo.html">many definitions</a>
          in computer science, within the context of Linked Data Capabilities
          a "linked data object" is an entity which is associated with a URI and
          which is capable of having proclamation chain based capabilities
          being invoked against it.
        </dd>

        <dt>method</dt>
        <dd>
          An argument of an invocation which directs what particular
          functionality of the object is being used.
          For example, an invocation against a file storage service
          may specify either a write method or a read method.
        </dd>

        <dt>proclamation / proclamation chain</dt>
        <dd>
          A proclamation is a linked data document which represents a
          capability to an object.
          Proclamations may be delegated by issuing new proclamations
          which point at previous proclamations, possibly with further
          caveats attached.

      <h2>Proclamations and Proclamation Chains</h2>

      <p>
        Linked Data Capabilities are encoded through "proclamation chains".
        Proclamations are linked data documents which express a grant
        of authority from some entity (or more commonly, an entitiy's
        specific key) to a specific subject, possibly restricted
        through "caveats".
        (This includes the possibility of revocation through a caveat
        that expresses such a mechanism.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Every proclamation MUST have:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <!-- TODO: What's the right way to say this?
             This sounds very json-ld centric -->
        <li>an associated <code>id</code></li>
        <li>the <code>type</code> set to <code>Proclamation</code></li>
        <li>
          a <code>subject</code>, which links to a linked data object
          to which this capability grants the authority to invoke
          operations upon
        </li>
        <li>
          a <code>signature</code> field, which MUST sign the document with
          <a href="https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/ld-signatures/">
            Linked Data Signatures</a>
          by one of the <code>subject</code>'s keys, or if this proclamation is
          being delegated through the <code>parentProclamation</code> property,
          by one of the keys granted access to this capability through the
          <code>grantedKey</code> property.
          <!-- TODO: Should this be by any of the keys which have authority
               to use this capability, or only the nearest grantedKey on the
               chain? -->
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        "Top-level" proclamations, which do not have a
        <code>parentProclamation</code> property, MUST have
        (and child proclamations MAY have):
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>grantedKey</code>, which links to one or more keys
          being granted authority to use this capability
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="note">
        Why don't all child proclamations require a grantedKey property?
        The reason is that it is perfectly reasonable for an entity which has
        access to a capability to give an attenuated capability to *itself* to
        be used in a specific context.
        Capabilities are not structured around "who has access" to something
        but rather holding onto a capability for a particular use, and in
        order to avoid confused deputy and ambient authority problems,
        in general objects should not hold on to a "bucket" of capabilities
        which grant them authority, but hold on to them within specific
        contexts for specific purposes.
        In general, when an object is granted a capability, it is important
        that it know for what specific purpose it has been granted that
        capability so that it does not become confused and use it in the
        wrong scenario.
        This is not unlike how in computer programs a procedure called with
        specific arguments understands for what the meaning of those arguments
        are and for what they may be used.

      <section id="delegation">
        <h2>Delegation through Proclamation Chains</h2>
        <p>
          <!-- TODO: Is parentProclamation too wordy? -->
          A proclamation MAY also have a <code>parentProclamation</code>
          property.
          A series of proclamations chained together in this way is called a
          "proclamation chain" and is how delegation of capabilities are
          handled in Linked Data Capabilities.
          New keys MAY be granted authority to use this proclamation through
          the associated <code>grantedKey</code> property.
          Proclamations with parents MUST NOT have a new <code>subject</code>
          property, and MUST be signed by either the original <code>subject</code>
          or one of the later <code>grantedKey</code> keys.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="caveats">
        <h2>Caveats</h2>
        <p>
          Every proclamation MAY add restrictions on the way the capability
          may be used by adding to the <code>caveat</code> property.
          Proclamations inherit the restrictions from all <code>caveat</code>
          properties of their parents, and MAY add new caveats in addition to
          those of their parents.
        </p>
        <p>
          The meaning of caveats are determined by their <code>type</code>
          and whatever other properties they have.
          Due to the way they are interpreted at invocation type by the
          <code>subject</code>, some mutual understanding of terminology
          must be understood between the entity adding a caveat and the
          subject evaluating (or any other parties observing) the invocation.

      <!-- TODO: move this to security considerations section -->
      <p class="note">
        Unlike access control lists, the focus of capablities is about
        what action is being performed by who is "holding" a

        performed.
